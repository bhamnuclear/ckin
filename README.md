# ckin
Kinematics tool including penetrability calculation via inclusion of WCLBES (and its dependencies from CERNLIBS).
This code can be used to calculate reaction and decay Q-values, print out atomic masses and binding energies (B.E.s) and calculate the corresponding Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF) value of the binding energy.
The input to ckin is the mass table from the latest mass evaulation (e.g. AME 2020 by W.J.Huang, M.Wang, F.G.Kondev, G.Audi and S.Naimi
Chinese Physics C45, 030002, March 2021).

Other options
The options are:
 1) Enter/change a reaction or decay.
 2) Calculate the reaction Q value.
 3) Work out some kinematics.
 4) Input ejectile energy and solve for excitation energy.
 5) Mass look-up and SEMF/B.E.s.
 6) Calculate resonant-reaction beam energy for a given excitation energy.
 7) Calculate penetrabilities and reduced widths.
